# Gesture Media Controller

Control your media (volume, play/pause, next/previous track) using hand gestures detected via your webcam. This project uses **Mediapipe** for hand tracking, **OpenCV** for webcam and overlay rendering, and **PyAutoGUI** to simulate media key presses.

A custom overlay shows your webcam feed in a designated box and displays a confirmation message whenever an action is triggered.
